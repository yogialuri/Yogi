Continuous Integration:

1) Develper works in a local dev enviornment ,the SCM System GitHub/Bit bucket wwhere source code is stored.

Query) GitHub/Bit bucket both are same - Differenet vendors but functaionality 


2) Developer commits and pushes code to GitHub where it auto triggers the CI pipeline ,the code is then downloaded from Github

Query) What is Pipleline,who will write the pipeline,If devops engineer writes the pipeline how do you identify it is pipleline and what it contains really.

Ans: Pipeline is nothing but set of stages & steps.Devops enginner creates pipeline.

3) It is build using Maven (POM.xml) ,MS Build or Gradle etc..based on technology use. 

Query) No clue about this sentence ,Is the sequence of steps after Jenkins autoriggers .Need more clarity of the sentence.

Ans: Maven and Gradle will be used Java app where as Ms Build is for .net tool.these are all build tools

4) Unit tests are run based on the technology like Junit or Nunit etc..


Query) As per my knowledge Junit will be used for Java applications, what about .net and what is Nunit means 

Ans: .Nunit is for .net

5) The Binaries are packaged 
eg: Jar,war - Java 
    zip -.Net
    Msi -?
    Ear -?
    query) please list out all the binaries for java and .net application

Ans: google 

6) Package is Published to artifactory management system which is Jfrog artifactory or Nexus etc..

Query) Package Publishement to artifactory management is automated if auotmated how it works   

Ans: It stores the build binaries,Every build is stored. 

7) Code scan is run using sonarqube pr ADSF scan

Query) As per my knowledge who will perform this task and why you required some idea on code review kind of tool

Ans: In Jenkins code scan sonar will be added in pipeline. 

8) Optionally there is a trigger to Deploy to dev.

Query) Is it reverse like Prod ->QA and QA-> Devway instead of dev to QA/stage, QA to Production sequence 

Ans: Webhooks will take CI and triggers CD 

9) Continuous Integration (CI) Invokes the Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline and the artiifcat is deployed to Linux or windows Target server 

Query) CI Pipeline and CD pipeline are same or differenet - 

Ans: CI is task is more on developers where as CD is for devops eng will write

However it is org dependent and CI and CD having both pipelines.

Continuous Deployment :

1) In this case this is more of devops operations,Devops operations team writes the automation code.

2) They can Operate in the local Dev enviornment or IDE of their choice.
                                                                                
								
Query) What is the differnece between local dev or Integrated devolpemnet enviornment (IDE) 
       Devops engineer requires local enviornment - silly question - YES ignore if not more inputs required -YES
       Ex:IDE -eclipse or visual studio or Atom

3) They Still have to work with the source code management system,which is Github and they store the automation code + Continous delivery

Query) If devops eng works in Github there is chance of mistakes ,loss of data in central repository and other implications . What is the best practices follow in Org.Ideally devops eng should have local env and write the automation code and then push to Github.This is all my assumption only.

Ans: Dev ops eng also works in loacl and source code management 

4) When Devops eng commits and pushes code to Github auto triggers continous deplpyment pipeline, which is combination of Jenkins and Maven (POM.xml) for Java projects.

Query) What is the use/purpose of Maven (POM.xml)  

Ans: POM.xml which is useful for build automation

5) The Deployment happens through the Ansible Tower.-  More explination required when the session comes

Ans: Ansible will be used Continuos deployment. Reusable scripts will be avaliable. 

6) The first step is ready artifact from Jfrog.

Query) Ready means after Jenkins + Maven move to Jfrog.

Ans: Yes
7) Now you need to move the artifacts from Dev to next enviornmnet .

8) We have a concept of Gating, Where an approver used to approve the movement of artifact from dev to higher stages.

Query) Generally who will approve the Gating in org ,you have mentioned the dev to higher stages means , Git hub to QA env -?

Ans: Email recives for entire team,any one can approve the approval.

9) Once the approval is done the artificat is deployed to any LLE ( Lowe level enviornments) through Ansible,funcational tests can ne run against the artifact.

Query) Is it higher level or lower level env bcz DEV to QA and QA to PROD is higher level env

Ans: Lower level enviornments means DEV and QA
     Higher env is PROD

10) After LLE the artifact can be moved to PROD through a gated approval 

Understanding : After UAT and then approval move to PROD - can you confirm 

Ans) Generally manually push the  code move from UAT to PROD in Org not by automation. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall flow for Jenkins:

-Prebuild
-Build
-Post Build actions 
Query - What is the use of Jenkins after post Build 
 ex: Post build one of steps is notification of Jenkins deployment to dev/qa/dev eng whether sucess ar fail. 

Ans:It will be covered in pipeline conecpts 

- Approver once again approves the artificat to move to Production

- Deployment happens to Production using Ansible.

Query ) Even same is QA also not only in PROD -YES

---------------------------------------------------------------

DevOps

-Maximize the time Spent colaborating with the business on Ideas.
-Code/Test/Deploy is faster using Agile Methodology
-Code and Solution can always be validated and automated.
-Constantly able to build out new business features frequently.
-Features / code are always "Production ready"
Query: It is based on Org release planning like monthly or biweekley etc..-Please confirm -YES
